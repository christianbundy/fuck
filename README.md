Murder
====

The easiest way to kill that stupid service that you can't figure out how to end.

## Installation

Use Homebrew to download and install the executable.

```sh
brew tap fraction/homebrew-formulae
brew install murder
```

Alternatively, download the executable into your path with a single command.

```sh
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/murder https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraction/murder/master/murder
```

## Usage

Pass a pattern of what to kill as an argument and watch it die. Boom.

```sh
murder meteor
```
